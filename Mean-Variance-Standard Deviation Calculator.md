## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

You can find the challenge at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator).

It can be overwhelming trying to make sense of it in one go so it's best if we can break it down to chunks:

### Problem Description:

You are asked to create a Python function called calculate() that takes a list of 9 numbers as input.

#### Step 1: Input Validation

The first thing we do is check if the input list contains exactly 9 numbers. If it doesn't, we raise an error with the message "List must contain nine numbers."

```
def calculate(numbers):
    if len(numbers) != 9:
        raise ValueError("List must contain nine numbers.")
```

#### Step 2: Data Conversion

We convert the input list of 9 numbers into a 3x3 matrix using the NumPy library. This means we organize the numbers into rows and columns.

```
    matrix = np.array(numbers).reshape(3, 3)
```

#### Step 3: Calculation of Statistics

We calculate various statistics for this 3x3 matrix. Specifically, we want to know:

The mean (average) of the numbers in each row and each column, and also for all the numbers combined (the flattened matrix).

The variance (a measure of how spread out the numbers are) in each row and each column, and for the flattened matrix.

The standard deviation (a measure of how much the numbers vary) in each row and each column, and for the flattened matrix.

The maximum and minimum values in each row and each column, and for the flattened matrix.

The sum of the numbers in each row and each column, and for the flattened matrix.

#### Step 4: Data Organization

We organize these statistics into a dictionary in a specific format:

The dictionary has keys for 'mean', 'variance', 'standard deviation', 'max', 'min', and 'sum'.

Each key contains a list of three values: one for rows, one for columns, and one for the flattened matrix.


*** COMBINING STEP 3 AND 4 ***

```
    result = {
        'mean': [list(matrix.mean(axis=0)), list(matrix.mean(axis=1)), matrix.mean()],
        'variance': [list(matrix.var(axis=0)), list(matrix.var(axis=1)), matrix.var()],
        'standard deviation': [list(matrix.std(axis=0)), list(matrix.std(axis=1)), matrix.std()],
        'max': [list(matrix.max(axis=0)), list(matrix.max(axis=1)), matrix.max()],
        'min': [list(matrix.min(axis=0)), list(matrix.min(axis=1)), matrix.min()],
        'sum': [list(matrix.sum(axis=0)), list(matrix.sum(axis=1)), matrix.sum()]
    }
```


#### Step 5: Return the Result

We return this dictionary as the result of the function.

```

```

Example Usage:

If you call the calculate() function with a list of 9 numbers, it will provide you with all these statistics organized in the way described above.

In simpler terms, the function takes a list of 9 numbers, arranges them into a 3x3 grid, and tells you various things about the numbers: their average, how much they vary, the largest 
and smallest numbers, and their total, both for rows, columns, and all of them together.
