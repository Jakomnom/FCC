## STUDENT DATABASE 1
This README provides a plain and simple explanation of the Student Database 1

## Overview
This database dump represent a simple academic database designed to manage information about students, courses, and majors. It includes tables for storing data related to students' personal information, the courses they are enrolled in, and the majors they have chosen.

### Database Details

Database Name: students

Database Version: PostgreSQL 12.9 (Ubuntu 12.9-2.pgdg20.04+1)

Dumped by: pg_dump version 12.9 (Ubuntu 12.9-2.pgdg20.04+1)

### Tables

The database contains the following tables:

Courses: This table stores information about courses, including a unique course ID and the course name.

Majors: Majors table keeps track of different majors, including a unique major ID and the major name.

Majors_Courses: This table represents a many-to-many relationship between majors and courses. It connects majors to the courses they require, using the major ID and course ID as foreign keys.

Students: The Students table stores data about students, including their student ID, first name, last name, major (linked to the major ID), and GPA.

### Data Relationships
#### The "majors_courses" table is used to establish relationships between majors and courses, allowing multiple courses to be associated with a single major and vice versa.
#### The "students" table has a foreign key relationship with the "majors" table, connecting students to their chosen majors.
### Data Constraints
#### The "courses," "majors," "majors_courses," and "students" tables include primary keys, ensuring the uniqueness and integrity of the data within these tables.
#### The "students" table has a foreign key constraint to link students with their respective majors.
#### The "majors_courses" table includes foreign key constraints for connecting courses and majors.
#### Please note that the data provided in this database dump appears to be minimal and may not represent a complete academic database. You can use this structure as a foundation for managing student, course, and major information, but additional data may be required for a fully functional system.

If you intend to restore or use this database for educational or testing purposes, you can do so using PostgreSQL tools or consult with a database administrator for assistance.
