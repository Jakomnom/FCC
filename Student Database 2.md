# Student Database 2 Dump README

This SQL code represents a database dump that provides a schema and sample data for three tables: `courses`, `majors`, and `students`. It includes sequences and constraints for data integrity.
This was the continuation from Student Database 1 from Relational Database course from freecodecamp.org

## Purpose
This database dump is designed to set up a basic educational database with information on courses, majors, and student records. It's intended for educational or testing purposes, allowing users to explore the structure and content of the database.

## Usage
You can restore the database using a PostgreSQL client with the following command:
```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -f dump_file.sql
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_database_name` with your PostgreSQL credentials and the target database name. Be cautious about data loss when restoring.

For detailed database management or queries, refer to PostgreSQL documentation or your preferred database tool.

Please ensure you back up your existing database before applying this dump.
